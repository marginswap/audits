# audits
**CertiK**: Seeing as we are building a completely new protocol from the ground up, we decided to acquired an audit from CertiK to assure ourselves and the community that the protocol we have developed works as it should. CertiK pointed out 1 critical, 5 major and 6 medium issues, which have all been fixed. The remainder of the findings are optimizations and language-level alternatives that do not affect the security of the system. We would like to thank CertiK for their hard work on this audit and keeping our users safe.
